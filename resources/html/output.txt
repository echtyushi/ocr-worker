your look withjusta few precise cuts. But
atotal-body overhaul? That’s beyond

the scopeofeventhe most proficient
coiffeur. Especially when the man
wieldingthetrimmertreats eating like

a passion project. For Jared Hohne, who
counts cooking up feasts with his wife

as his favourite hobby, chowing down
was partofhisregularroutine. Asthe
portions got bigger, the lifestyle got more
sedentary—‘“In short, I most certainly
wasn't healthy,” saysthe barber.

Hisepiphany was atwo-parter. First,
there was a holiday in Knysna where
aweigh-intotake ride on one ofthearea’s
ziplines saw Hohnetipthe scales at
120kg. “Thewoman helpingus letout an
‘eish’ when shesaw the number,” hesays.
That hurtless than being barred from
joining his family on the lines because
hewasovertheweight limit. The second

“Init, lookedinthemirrorandIwasin
shape. Nosix pack, but Ididn’thave rolls
of fat,” he says. Itwasatiny moment of
feeling good about his body and he woke
up motivated to chasethat high.

Before he started his weight lossjourney,
Hohne hitthe books. That’s where he
came across “One Meala Day” also
knownas OMAD. “It’s definitely notthe
healthiest way to lose weight, but I needed
tomakebig changes andthe best option
for mewastogofull tilt,” he says. “Any

Studies have shownthatthis approach

To supplement his new meal plan,
Hohne signed up fora local gym where
thetrainers (and othertrainees) would
hold him accountable for pitching up

at least four days per week. While he
credits his diet for the majority of his
weight loss, he says his initiation into
the halls of iron has been crucialtothe
second partof his journey: “I’m now
enjoying building muscleand strength.”

Injust nine months, Hohne was able

to lose 21kg, turning that dream (and
ambitions of riding azipline with his
family) intoareality. “Ialso feel way
more motivated to get out of the house
anddothings,” he adds. “AndI’m feeling
stronger every day. I’m looking forward
to building a healthier, happier life with
my wife for our future.”
